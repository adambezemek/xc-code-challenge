## Description

The requested three-item content grid has been developed with the help of Sass. The page is fully responsive without the use of any CSS Frameworks. The user is able to swap any of the images inside the three mods, just click on drop for the images to change positions. The drag and drop feature also works on mobile and tablets.

Webpack has been used on this project with the task of starting a local server that watches the file "Index.js" for any changes and rebuilds locally on save. 

**To access the local server just type on your command console: npm start**

You are able to edit any text on the page from the Index.js file. When the localhost server is up and running, just save any content inside this file for the page to refresh the build.

To output the distribution assets, just type **npm run build**

Thank you for this opportunity as i've trully enjoyed working on this challenge!
