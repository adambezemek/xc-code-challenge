### Notes

 I should have asked if the requirements included just swapping the images, or swapping the entire blocks of text as well. Iterating with v-for in a different way, or exploring the options with Vuedraggable may have helped.

 While Vue hasn't been my number one choice for recent projects, it's incredibly versatile, and I can see how the concepts blend nicely between React and Angular. I spent a little time doing my own crash course to make sure I was ready to go with CLI v3. I'll be sure to put more time in, it's pretty nifty.
